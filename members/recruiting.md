# Recruiting

Limit Break is a new sHC static with aims to complete the next upcoming savage tier in the first week. We wish to raid everyday when the tier releases, and have a team without toxicity. Limit Breakâ€™s standard encourages people to give and receive constructive feedback, helping out your team members so that we can get those clears.

## Available slots

<VPTeamMembers v-if="recruiting" size="small" :members="recruiting" />
<!-- No available slots. -->

## :page_with_curl: Requirements

It is really important that you understand your class and job very well. You do not have to have experience in a hardcore static or ultimate, just have hardcore mindset and strong prog mentality.

:ballot_box_with_check: Discord VC <br>
:ballot_box_with_check: Team Player  <br>
:ballot_box_with_check: Prog mentality  <br>
:ballot_box_with_check: Savage experience  <br>

On top of this we are expecting our members to aquire pre-bis *(crafted and pentamelded, tome gear and extreme trial weapan)*. We can help out with crafting :hammer_and_pick: if needed.

## :date: Schedule

To complete our aim, there will be daily raiding for 10 hours a day upon release, with breaks throughtout the day. You will be expected to take the first week off work. If a clear has not been achieved in the first week, then the second week onwards we will be raiding daily at a reduced schedule to fit with work. Once cleared, raid days will be reduced to one reclear day a week.

The schedule is fluid at the moment and can still be adjusted a little. The aim is to set of 10h a day, but we will fit in breaks between lockout sessions and a larger break at some point of the day.
